What will happen when my Special Account is closed and what is the rationale for doing so? FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter I am aged 55 and above. What will happen when my Special Account is closed and what is the rationale for doing so? Today, members aged 55 and above have two CPF accounts that hold savings intended for retirement payouts: the Special Account (SA) and the Retirement Account (RA). Both SA and RA savings earn the same long-term interest rate. However, some SA savings can be withdrawn on demand from age 55. As a principle, only savings that cannot be withdrawn on demand should earn the long-term interest rate, and savings that can be withdrawn on demand should earn the short-term interest rate. To better align CPF interest rates to the nature of CPF savings in each CPF account, we will close your SA if you are aged 55 and above from early 2025. SA savings will be transferred to your RA, up to your Full Retirement Sum (FRS). These savings will continue to earn the long-term interest rate. If you have set aside your FRS, whether fully in cash or with a mixture of property and cash, any remaining SA savings will be transferred to your Ordinary Account (OA), where they remain withdrawable and will earn the short-term interest rate. You can choose to transfer your OA savings to the RA at any time, up to the prevailing Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS) to earn long-term interest rates and receive higher retirement payouts. Once transferred, the RA savings can only be streamed out to you in retirement payouts. With the raised ERS from 1 January 2025 , more than 99% of the members aged 55 and above today would be able to transfer all their SA savings, that were channelled to the OA due to the closure of SA, to the RA. You will be notified after the transfer of all SA savings to your RA and/or OA, and closure of your SA in early 2025. You will also be able to check the amounts transferred from your SA to your RA and/or OA from your CPF statement. No action is required from you now. Watch the video on how the SA will be closed for you from early 2025. More details on the implementation date will be shared in the second half of 2024. Was this article helpful?

What can I do to continue earning the interest rate that the Special Account pays? FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Once I set aside my Full Retirement Sum, my Special Account savings will be transferred to the Ordinary Account which pays lower interest. What can I do to continue earning the interest rate that the Special Account pays? If you wish to earn higher interest and receive higher retirement payouts, you may transfer your Special Account (SA) savings that were channelled to the Ordinary Account (OA) due to the closure of SA, to the Retirement Account (RA), up to the prevailing Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS). The RA interest rate is the same as the SA. From 1 January 2025, the ERS will be raised to four times of the Basic Retirement Sum to allow members to save more in the RA and receive higher payouts , if they want. With the change, the ERS in 2025 would be $426,000 1 , up from $308,700 in 2024. Hence, if you are aged 55 and above in 2025, you can save up to $426,000 in the RA. The raised ERS would allow more than 99% of members aged 55 and above today to transfer all their SA savings to the RA. Please note that CPF transfers are irreversible and the savings are set aside to boost your monthly payouts in retirement. Thus, the amount transferred cannot be withdrawn for any other purpose such as housing, investment, or immediate needs after age 55. Read more on how the top-ups will be used . You can also invest the OA savings in low-risk investments, such as T-bills and fixed deposits, under the CPF Investment Scheme (CPFIS). 1 This is the limit for the savings set aside in the RA (excluding amounts such as interest earned, government grants received, plus retirement withdrawals).

With the closure of Special Account (SA), CPF contributions that go to the SA currently, as well as any increase in CPF contributions allocated to SA from 1 January 2025, will be fully allocated to the member’s Retirement Account (RA) instead, up to the Full Retirement Sum (FRS), to boost retirement payouts. For members who have set aside the FRS in the RA, these contributions will be channelled to the Ordinary Account (OA). This will ensure that the additional contributions continue to earn the highest possible CPF interest rate to provide an even bigger boost to retirement payouts. RA balances currently earn a minimum interest rate of 4% a year, compared to a minimum of 2.5% in the OA. Plus, members aged 55 and above earn an extra interest of 2% per annum on the first $30,000 and 1% per annum on the next $30,000 of their combined CPF balances (capped at $20,000 for OA).

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter How much interest will I earn on the Special Account (SA) savings that are transferred to my Retirement Account and Ordinary Account in the month my SA is closed? As CPF interest is computed monthly, your Special Account (SA) savings (excluding contributions and refunds received in the month) that are transferred to your Retirement Account (RA), up to the Full Retirement Sum, will earn RA interest for that month. Remaining SA savings which are withdrawable and transferred to your Ordinary Account (OA) will earn OA interest for that month. If you wish to earn higher interest and receive higher retirement payouts, you may transfer your SA savings to the RA, up to the prevailing Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS) before your SA is closed by early 2025 1 . The amount transferred to RA (excluding contributions and refunds received in the month) will earn the RA interest rate in the month of transfer. The RA interest rate is the same as the SA. 1 Please note that (i) CPF transfers are irreversible and the savings are set aside to boost your monthly payouts in retirement, and (ii) the normal processing time for CPF transfers is five working days upon receipt of application, and can take longer if the volume of applications is high.

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter What happens to my CPF savings when I turn 55? When you turn 55, we will transfer your CPF savings, up to your Full Retirement Sum (FRS), to create your Retirement Account (RA). The savings in your RA is meant to provide you with payouts in retirement. Your Special Account (SA) savings will be transferred first , followed by your Ordinary Account (OA) savings. From early 2025, the SA will be closed for members aged 55 and above to be in line with the principle that savings set aside for retirement should continue to earn long-term interest rates, while savings that can be withdrawn at any time should earn the short-term interest rate. If you have savings in SA when the SA is closed, it will be transferred to the RA, up to your FRS, so that you can receive higher retirement payouts. Once you have set aside your FRS in RA, the remaining SA savings will be transferred to the OA and can be withdrawn at any time. If you do not have enough RA savings to make up the FRS and have used your CPF savings for your property, we will use your CPF savings withdrawn for your property (including accrued interest) to meet your FRS. The maximum amount that can be used is your Basic Retirement Sum. When you sell your property, you will have to restore your RA up to your FRS with your sales proceeds. It is not mandatory for you to top up your RA if you are unable to set aside your FRS . However, you may wish to top up your RA for higher monthly payouts. You can also enjoy tax relief for cash top-ups up to the FRS. After your SA is closed in early 2025, you can also opt to transfer your OA savings to the RA up to prevailing ERS to earn long-term interest rates and receive higher retirement payouts. Did you know? You can use the Monthly payout estimator to estimate how much you need to top up to reach your desired monthly payouts. If you are born in 1958 or after and wish to start your monthly payouts, there will be another transfer of your SA and/or OA savings, up to your FRS, to your RA , if you have not met your FRS. This transfer allows you to receive higher monthly payouts. Find out more about the retirement sums . Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter In setting aside the Full Retirement Sum in my Retirement Account, why are my Special Account savings transferred before my Ordinary Account savings? The savings in your Special Account (SA) are meant for your retirement needs, while your Ordinary Account (OA) savings can be used to meet shorter-term expenditure needs such as housing. Hence, when you turn 55, SA savings are first transferred to your Retirement Account (RA) to help you set aside the retirement sum, which will eventually be streamed out as monthly payouts when you reach your payout eligibility age. Did you know? If you wish to earn higher interest on your OA savings (which earns at least 2.5% interest* per annum) and boost your monthly payouts, you can make a CPF transfer to your RA (which earns at least 4% interest* per annum), up to the current Enhanced Retirement Sum. Do note that for CPF transfers to RA, your SA savings (if any) will be transferred first followed by your OA savings. * Based on the current interest rate floor on Ordinary and Retirement Account monies.

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Do I need to top up my Retirement Account and will I receive monthly payouts if I am unable to set aside my Full Retirement Sum? It is not mandatory for you to top up your Retirement Account (RA) if you are unable to set aside your Full Retirement Sum (FRS) . You can still receive monthly payouts anytime from your payout eligibility age, and the payout amount will be based on your RA savings. However, you may wish to top up your RA for higher monthly payouts. You can also enjoy tax relief for cash top-ups up to the FRS. Did you know? You can use the Monthly payout estimator to estimate how much you need to top up to reach your desired monthly payouts. If you receive contributions, government grants or other refunds in your CPF accounts after 55, they will be transferred to your RA up to your FRS (or Basic Retirement Sum if you own a property) on your next withdrawal. If you are born in 1958 or after and wish to start your monthly payouts, there will be another transfer of your SA and/or OA savings, up to your FRS, to your RA , if you have not met your FRS. This transfer allows you to receive higher monthly payouts. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter What are the retirement sums - Basic Retirement Sum (BRS), Full Retirement Sum (FRS) and Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS)? Planning for your retirement is easier with the retirement sums – Basic Retirement Sum (BRS), Full Retirement Sum (FRS), and Enhanced Retirement Sum (ERS). They provide a guide on the CPF savings you need to reach your desired monthly payouts in retirement . The BRS is meant to provide you with monthly payouts in retirement to cover basic living needs, excluding rental expenses. The FRS is two times of BRS and can provide you with higher monthly payouts that also cover rental expenses. That is why when you turn 55, your CPF savings up to your FRS is set aside in your Retirement Account (RA) to provide you with monthly payouts in retirement. If you own a property in Singapore with remaining lease that lasts you until you are 95 or older, you have the flexibility to meet your FRS with a mixture of property (up to half your FRS) and cash, and can apply to withdraw part of your RA savings down to your BRS using your property . If you wish to receive even higher payouts for your desired retirement lifestyle, you can choose to set aside more by making a top-up , up to the current ERS . The ERS is the maximum amount that you can top up to your RA, and is increased yearly for those who wish to receive higher payouts. From 2025, the ERS will be raised from 3 times the BRS to 4 times to enable members to voluntarily commit more savings for even higher payouts. To find out how much you can top up, log in to your Retirement dashboard . See what are the retirement sums applicable to you . Ultimately, how much you set aside depends on your CPF balances and desired monthly payouts. It’s important to plan ahead by assessing how much payouts you need to meet your expenses in retirement.

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Why are the retirement sums increasing yearly? The increase in retirement sums is due to the following: Increase in cost of living As prices of goods and services rise over time, we will need to save more for retirement to ensure that our savings will still be sufficient to cover higher expenses in the future. Increase in life expectancy As people are living longer, we will need more savings to last throughout our retirement. Increase in standard of living As incomes increase over time, our basic retirement expectations and expenses will also naturally increase. Setting aside more savings allows us to receive higher monthly payouts to afford higher retirement expenses in future. However, if you are already 55, the yearly increase won't affect you. The retirement sum you need to set aside depends on when you turn 55 and is fixed for the rest of your life. It's important to keep in mind that the amount needed for retirement has increased over the years. For example, if the Full Retirement Sum had remained unchanged from $30,000 when it was first introduced in 1987 (previously known as the Minimum Sum), it would only provide a monthly payout of about $300 today. This amount would not be enough to cover daily living expenses and rent. Overall, the goal of increasing retirement savings is to help individuals build a financial foundation that will enable them to support themselves through retirement. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter What happens when I am reaching 65? Three months before your Payout Eligibility Age of 65, you will receive a notification from CPFB on what you need to know when you approach 65. The notification will direct you to the personalised Plan my monthly payouts (PMP) service where you can instruct us to start or defer your payouts, view your estimated payouts, explore options for higher payouts, and confirm your bank account details. To receive higher payouts: If you wish to have higher monthly payouts, you can use your available CPF savings to increase your payouts through the same PMP service . The savings you can use include your available Ordinary, Special Accounts (OSA) savings, and an additional amount of up to 20% of your retirement savings (applicable for members born in 1958 or after). It is important to note that using more CPF savings to increase your payouts will correspondingly reduce the amount available for your future lump sum withdrawal from 65. You can have a better understanding of the impact on your withdrawable savings through the Plan my monthly payouts (PMP) service as well. For existing CPF LIFE members If you have previously joined CPF LIFE before reaching age 65, your monthly payouts will automatically start from the month you turn 65, unless you use the personalised Plan my monthly payouts (PMP) service to instruct us to defer your CPF LIFE monthly payouts. Please note that you can only defer your CPF LIFE monthly payouts up to age 70. The PMP service will also allow you to view your estimated payouts, explore your options for higher payouts or confirm your bank account details. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Why does CPF Board not start my payouts automatically at 65? We understand that every member has unique retirement goals and needs. That is why we do not assume that everyone wants to start their payouts at 65. Your CPF savings earn risk-free interest rates* of up to 6% per annum , which means the longer you wait to start your payouts, the more your retirement savings will grow. This increase in savings will result in higher monthly payouts under CPF LIFE. Starting payouts automatically at 65 means denying members this option. That is why we always encourage our members to instruct us when they want to start their payouts, as they would be the best judge of their own circumstances. Here's an interesting fact: For every year that you defer your CPF LIFE payouts, your monthly payout amount increases by up to 7%. This means that if you defer for 5 years, your monthly payout could increase by up to 35%. Hence, weigh your options and make the decision that is best for you and your retirement goals. * Based on the current 4% interest rate floor on Special and Retirement Account monies.

We encourage you to use the personalised Plan my monthly payout s service to help you decide what best fits your retirement needs, and to submit your instructions. If we do not receive any instructions from you, we will start your payouts automatically when you reach 70 and your monthly payouts will be paid to the bank account provided under your Account settings . If you are born in 1958 or after and have not met your FRS, there will be another transfer of your Special Account (SA) and/or Ordinary Account (OA) savings to your Retirement Account (RA) to set aside your Full Retirement Sum (FRS) in cash. You can use the Plan my monthly payouts service to know if this transfer applies to you and how much will be transferred to your RA. This service is applicable to you three months before you reach 65. Once your monthly payout starts, please also note that any remaining amount from the additional withdrawable amount of up to 20% of your retirement savings will be transferred to your OA for your future withdrawals. Note: If you belong to the small group of members who have previously joined CPF LIFE before reaching age 65, your payouts will start automatically at 65, or the age (up to 70) you have chosen to start your payouts.

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Why do I need CPF LIFE? Nobody can predict how long anyone will actually live. Therefore, planning how much of your retirement savings to use for living expenses is a dilemma – Spend too much and you might not have enough if you live longer than you thought; spend too little and you might deprive yourself from fully enjoying your hard-earned savings. With increasing advances in technology and healthcare, you are likely to live longer than your grandparents’ or parents’ generation. Therefore, you cannot predict how long you will live by looking at how long your parents or grandparents live. Otherwise, you may underestimate your lifespan and find your savings depleted with many more years to live when you are no longer able to work. With CPF LIFE, you do not need to worry about being caught in such a situation but have the assurance of having a steady stream of income, no matter what age you live to. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter How much CPF savings do I need to join CPF LIFE? There is no minimum amount of CPF savings required for joining CPF LIFE. However, it is important to consider how much savings you have in your Retirement Account (RA) as this will determine how much monthly payouts you will receive. If you join CPF LIFE with a low RA balance (which is used to pay for the premium for your CPF LIFE plan), you may receive a low monthly payout which may not be enough to support your retirement needs. You can consider topping up your RA and use the Monthly payout estimator to estimate your monthly payout to see if it is worthwhile doing so before you join CPF LIFE. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter What are the CPF LIFE plans available and which is the right plan for me? There are three CPF LIFE plans to choose from – Escalating Plan, Standard Plan and Basic Plan. Do plan for your retirement with inflation in mind. For example, if your monthly expenditure is $1,000 today, you may need about $1,500 monthly payouts to maintain the same lifestyle in 20 years’ time. Choose your CPF LIFE plan based on how willing you are to adjust your retirement lifestyle, as things become more expensive. If you are worried about the rising costs of living, you can consider the Escalating Plan which provides monthly payouts that start lower initially but grow by 2% every year for life. The growing payouts protects you against inflation and generally helps you maintain your retirement lifestyle. Read more about how the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan works . If you are willing to live a more modest lifestyle and buy less as years pass, you may find the Standard Plan which provides steady payouts suitable for you. Payouts do not grow to protect you against inflation so you'll have to lower your lifestyle to buy less as things get more expensive in the years ahead. Payouts start higher than the Escalating Plan, but will eventually become lower than the Escalating Plan. Read more about how the CPF LIFE Standard Plan works . If you don’t mind starting with lower monthly payouts which will be progressively lower later on, then the Basic Plan is good enough. The Basic Plan is a legacy plan carried over from the time CPF LIFE was first introduced in 2009. Compared to the Standard Plan which gives higher and steady monthly payouts, Basic Plan payouts are lower and will get progressively lower when your combined CPF balances eventually fall below $60,000. Read more about how the CPF LIFE Basic Plan works . In all three plans, you will enjoy payouts no matter how long you live, your premiums will enjoy risk-free CPF interest rates , and any remaining CPF LIFE premium balance will be given to your beneficiaries, together with your remaining CPF savings when you pass on. In other words, you and your loved ones will always get back the premium that you have put into CPF LIFE. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter How does the CPF LIFE Escalating Plan work? The CPF LIFE Escalating Plan is a suitable option if you want to protect your retirement income from rising prices. Under this plan you will receive payouts that increase by 2% each year. Although the payouts start lower, they will eventually become higher than the Standard Plan and Basic Plan payouts. The Escalating Plan gives you peace of mind knowing that you can generally maintain your standard of living even as the cost of living goes up during your retirement years. For example, if you start with a monthly payout of $1,000 when you turn 65, it will increase by 2% each year and reach around $1,500 when you are 85. The 2% increase takes place every year in the same month that you receive your first payout. Under this plan, all your Retirement Account savings will be deducted as CPF LIFE premium when you join CPF LIFE, which can be anytime from 65 to 70. Your CPF LIFE monthly payouts will first be paid from your CPF LIFE premium. When your CPF LIFE premium is depleted, you will continue to receive the monthly payouts from the interest that you and other CPF LIFE members have accumulated, no matter how long you live.

CPF LIFE Escalating Plan payouts are not specifically matched to actual inflation in each year so that the increase in payouts is predictable and stable. By fixing the increase at 2% per year, CPF LIFE can provide some protection against inflation while keeping premiums at a more affordable level. Additionally, the 2% increase is meant to be a conservative estimate of the average inflation rate over time, which can vary from year to year. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter How does the CPF LIFE Basic Plan work? CPF LIFE Basic Plan is a legacy plan carried over from the time CPF LIFE was first introduced in 2009. Many members would find the Standard or Escalating Plan more suited to their needs. If you opt for the Basic Plan, about 80-90% of your Retirement Account (RA) savings will be directly used to provide payouts until age 90. The remaining 10-20% will be deducted as your CPF LIFE premium when you join CPF LIFE and used to provide payouts from age 90 for the rest of your life. As less is used for your CPF LIFE premium, the monthly payout will be lower compared to the Standard Plan. The monthly payouts under Basic Plan will get progressively lower when your combined CPF balances eventually fall below $60,000. This is because the extra interest earned on the first $60,000 of your CPF balances is credited to your RA and factored into your monthly payouts. As your balances are withdrawn over time to provide you with monthly payouts, the amount of monthly payouts and extra interest will decrease when your balances fall below $60,000.

But why did Government introduce Basic Plan previously? Can I change to another plan? FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter I know that CPF LIFE Basic Plan is a legacy option. But why did Government introduce Basic Plan previously? Can I change to another plan? When the CPF LIFE Basic Plan was first introduced in 2009, it was better than the previous default monthly payout scheme which did not provide payouts for life. However, to better suit Singaporeans’ evolving needs, we have since introduced Standard and Escalating plans. The Basic Plan is retained as a legacy plan. Monthly payouts under the Basic Plan start lower than Standard Plan and will get progressively lower when your combined CPF balances eventually fall below $60,000 . If you are on the Basic Plan or other legacy plans such as the Balanced, Plus and Income plans, you can consider changing to the Escalating Plan to benefit from increasing payouts or the Standard Plan to enjoy higher and level payouts. You can make the change anytime. It is important to note that: Once you have changed to the Standard or Escalating Plan, you cannot change back to a legacy plan. All your Retirement Account savings, including the premium refunded from your Basic Plan, will be deducted as CPF LIFE premium when the Standard or Escalating Plan is issued to you.

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Can I change from a legacy plan (Basic, Balanced, Plus or Income Plan) to the Standard or Escalating Plan? The Basic, Balanced, Plus and Income plans were introduced when CPF LIFE was first launched in 2009. Under these plans, extra interest earned on the first $60,000 of your CPF balances is credited to your Retirement Account (RA) and factored into your monthly payouts. As your balances are withdrawn over time to provide you with monthly payouts, the amount of monthly payouts and extra interest will decrease when your balances fall below $60,000. If you are currently on any of the above legacy plans, you have the option to change to either the Escalating Plan or Standard Plan . Changing to the Escalating Plan will provide you with increasing payouts over time, while changing to the Standard Plan will provide you with level payouts. You can make the change anytime. It is important to note that: Once you have changed to the Standard or Escalating Plan, you cannot change back to a legacy plan. All your RA savings, including the premium refunded from your legacy plan, will be deducted as CPF LIFE premium when the Standard or Escalating Plan is issued to you. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter What is the breakeven point for my CPF LIFE plan i.e. the age when my CPF LIFE premium is fully depleted, and should it matter? Unlike investment products where we would aim to maximise returns, CPF LIFE is a national longevity insurance annuity product that aims to protect us against the possibility of having nothing to live on when our retirement savings are used up. As we cannot predict how long we will live, it is not relevant to consider the age when our CPF LIFE premium is fully depleted. If you pass away before your CPF LIFE premium is depleted, your beneficiaries will always get back any remaining CPF LIFE premium that you have put into your plan. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter What happens to my Retirement Account savings when I join CPF LIFE? It is dependent on the CPF LIFE plan you choose. If you opt for the Escalating or Standard Plan, all your Retirement Account (RA) savings will be used as your CPF LIFE premium. If you opt for the Basic Plan, about 80-90% of your RA savings will be directly used to provide payouts until age 90. The remaining 10-20% will be deducted as your CPF LIFE premium when you join CPF LIFE and used to provide payouts from age 90 for the rest of your life. As less is used for your CPF LIFE premium, the monthly payout will be lower compared to the Standard Plan. The Basic plan payouts will also decrease correspondingly as your balances are withdrawn over time to provide you with monthly payouts and earn less extra interest*. * The extra interest is earned on the first $60,000 of your CPF balances and is used to increase your payouts.

How can I increase my future monthly payouts? FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter I have not joined CPF LIFE yet. How can I increase my future monthly payouts? There are a few ways to increase your future CPF LIFE monthly payouts: Topping up your Retirement Account (RA) under the Retirement Sum Topping-up Scheme You or your loved ones can make cash top-ups and CPF transfers to your RA up to the current Enhanced Retirement Sum by logging in with your Singpass at cpf.gov.sg/rstuform . The more RA savings you use to join CPF LIFE, the higher your monthly payouts. Deferring your monthly payouts (up to 70) Consider deferring your payouts if you are still working or have other income. Your monthly payouts will increase by up to 7% for each year that you defer. If you choose to defer until 70, you could get up to a 35% increase in payouts as your CPF savings would have accumulated more interest. You will only need to decide your CPF LIFE plan when you wish to start your payouts. The latest age you can start your payouts is 70, after which they will automatically begin. Monetising your property If you own a property, you can also consider monetising your property . You can use the Monthly payout estimator to find out how much RA savings you need, or the age you need to start your payouts to get your desired monthly payout. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Can I defer the start of my CPF LIFE monthly payouts beyond 70? The purpose of CPF savings is to provide members with monthly payouts in their retirement. Hence, you will have to start your CPF LIFE monthly payouts, including any Additional Monthly Payouts (AMP), latest by age 70. We understand that some members think of their savings in CPF as an investment to enjoy the interest rates. If you have no immediate need for the payouts, you can consider investing them outside the CPF system. Do note that investing outside of CPF carries a certain level of risk and requires careful consideration. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter How will my CPF LIFE monthly payouts be adjusted and when will payout adjustments be effected? We want to ensure that your CPF LIFE monthly payouts are sustainable over the long term. As such, our actuarial consultant reviews them yearly and take into account the following: Deviations in mortality experience. If more people live longer than expected in the long term, the monthly payouts might be lower, and vice versa. Deviations in interest rates. If interest rates are higher than expected, the monthly payouts might be higher, and vice versa. The revised payout, if any, will take effect every July of the year. We will notify you if there is an adjustment in your monthly payouts. Rest assured that any changes are expected to be small and gradual. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter How will changes to my Retirement Account affect my CPF LIFE monthly payouts? Changes to your Retirement Account (RA) can affect your monthly payouts. This is because your RA savings is one of the factors in determining your CPF LIFE payouts . Outflow from your RA, such as lump sum withdrawals will reduce your CPF LIFE monthly payouts. On the other hand, inflows to your RA, such as top-ups, or refunds from selling your property or investments will be automatically used to increase your CPF LIFE premium, and allow you to receive higher monthly payouts. If you have started receiving your CPF LIFE monthly payouts, we will inform you of any revision in your monthly payouts in the following month after the outflow/inflow of funds.

What are the monthly payout options that I can choose from? You have the flexibility to start receiving your monthly payouts anytime between 65 and 70. However, if you do not submit any instructions on your payouts by the time you turn 70, your monthly payouts will automatically start on your birthday month. In addition, you may have some CPF savings which are withdrawable for your immediate needs. Instead of withdrawing the amount in a lump sum, you can consider the following: Use the withdrawable amount (in part or in full) to increase your monthly payouts; or Retain the savings in your CPF account to earn interest, and withdraw them when the need arises. If you choose to retain your CPF savings, any additional withdrawable savings from 65 in your Retirement Account will be transferred to your Ordinary Account in the month you start your payouts, for your future withdrawal. Eligible members can use the Plan my monthly payouts service to find out more about their monthly payout details, provide their payout instructions and confirm their bank account details.

You can only cancel your CPF LIFE plan if you are withdrawing your CPF savings for the following reasons. You have a reduced life expectancy due to a medical condition, as certified by an accredited doctor . Severe medical conditions that cause you to be permanently unfit for work or to lack mental capacity permanently can also be considered. You have closed your CPF account as you are a non-Singapore Citizen or a non-Permanent Resident. You are fully exempted from setting aside the retirement sum in your Retirement Account because you are receiving a monthly pension / annuity payout. Upon cancellation of your CPF LIFE plan, you will receive a refund of your CPF LIFE premium balance. If your CPF LIFE premium has been fully paid to you as monthly payouts, there will be no remaining premium balance to refund. Was this article helpful?

In the event of your passing, any CPF LIFE unused premium (i.e. CPF LIFE premium balance), together with your remaining CPF savings, will be refunded to your loved ones. The interest on your CPF LIFE premium that has not been paid to you is pooled and goes towards providing monthly payouts for surviving CPF LIFE members. This is part and parcel of risk-pooling, similar to other types of insurance, and it ensures that all CPF LIFE members can receive payouts for as long as they live. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter How much CPF LIFE premium balance will my beneficiaries receive when I pass away? After you pass away, your beneficiaries will receive your CPF LIFE premium balance, which is the total CPF LIFE premium that you have paid minus the total payouts you have received, together with any remaining CPF savings. For example, if you paid a CPF LIFE premium of $200,000 and pass away after receiving a monthly payout of $1,000 for 10 months, we will pay your CPF LIFE premium balance of $190,000 (i.e. $200,000 - [$1,000 x 10 months]), together with any CPF savings to your beneficiaries. On the other hand, if you pass away before receiving any payouts, we will pay your CPF LIFE premium balance of $200,000, together with any remaining CPF savings to your beneficiaries.

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Do I really need to be concerned about outliving my monthly payouts? Yes, you should be concerned about outliving your monthly payouts. As we cannot predict how long we will live, it is not easy to determine how much we need for our retirement. For example, spending too much might result in you not having enough, while saving too much could end up depriving yourself. With advancements in technology and healthcare, we can expect to live longer than previous generations. However, many people tend to underestimate their lifespan and fail to save enough for their retirement. To enjoy peace of mind in your retirement years, you can join CPF LIFE which provides monthly payouts no matter how long you live. On the other hand, if you are not on CPF LIFE, your monthly payouts will stop once your CPF savings run out. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Can I choose to retain my Special Account and Ordinary Account savings instead of automatically disbursing them as payouts when my Retirement Account is depleted? No, you cannot choose to retain your Special Account (SA) and Ordinary Account (OA) savings. CPF is designed to provide you with an income in retirement. The auto-disbursement of your SA and OA savings ensures that you continue to receive a steady stream of retirement income even when your Retirement Account has been depleted.

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter How are monthly payouts calculated if I am not on CPF LIFE? If you are not on CPF LIFE, your monthly payouts are calculated to last for up to 20 years based on the prevailing base interest rate earned on your Retirement Account savings when you start your payouts. As Singaporeans live longer, more than half of those aged 65 today are expected to live more than 20 years. To protect you against the risk of outliving your payouts, the extra interest paid by the Government (up to 2% per year) on your retirement savings is used to extend your payouts beyond 20 years, up to age 90* or another five years, whichever ends later. *Up to age 90, or another five years, whichever ends later. You can use the payout estimator to estimate the amount of monthly payouts you can receive from your retirement savings. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter If I have a pension or annuity, can I withdraw my retirement savings? You can withdraw your retirement savings if you have a pension or annuity that provides you with monthly payouts for life. The amount of retirement savings you can withdraw will depend on the monthly payout you receive from your pension/annuity . Generally, only pensions under the Singapore Government will be considered. As for annuities, only those bought using cash or under the CPF Investment Scheme will be considered. The annuities must also be administered by Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)-registered insurance companies and satisfy the requirements under the Insurance Act. Additionally, you must be the policyholder and sole insured person of the annuity policy. Investment instruments such as endowments and bonds are not allowed as they generally do not provide the policyholder with a lifelong income. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Why can't I withdraw my top-ups from my retirement savings if I have an alternative pension/annuity? Top-ups to your retirement savings are meant to build up your retirement savings and boost your retirement payouts. Hence, they cannot be withdrawn as cash in a lump sum or used for other purposes. In addition to earning risk-free interest rates on your top-ups, you might have also benefited from tax relief. Allowing withdrawals of the top-ups would defeat the purpose of the scheme and the incentives given. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Why do I need to own a property before I can withdraw part of my Retirement Account savings? If you do not own a property*, it's important to consider rental costs when planning for your retirement. This means you may need to set aside more savings for higher monthly payouts to cover these living expenses. On the other hand, if you own a property*, you need not worry about rental costs in retirement. In addition, you would also have the option to generate extra retirement income by monetising your property. This is why members who own property* can choose to set aside their Full Retirement Sum (FRS) with a mixture of property (up to half the FRS) and cash and withdraw part of their Retirement Account savings down to their Basic Retirement Sum^ if they have other immediate retirement cash needs. *The property must be in Singapore and lasts you until at least age 95. ^ Excluding interest, any government grants and top-ups made under the Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme.

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter How is the withdrawable amount computed? The amount you can withdraw from your CPF account depends on the year you are born and the balances in your CPF account. For members born in 1958 or after: Amount you can withdraw from 55 If the savings in your Special Account and Ordinary Account are: $5,000 or less, you can withdraw all your Special Account and Ordinary Account savings. Between $5,000 and your Full Retirement Sum, you can withdraw: $5,000; and Any Retirement Account savings* above your Basic Retirement Sum, if you pledge your property with a remaining lease that can last you to at least 95 years old. More than your Full Retirement Sum, you can withdraw: $5,000, or your SA and OA savings above your Full Retirement Sum, whichever is higher; and Any Retirement Account savings* above your Basic Retirement Sum, if you pledge your property with a remaining lease that can last you to at least 95 years old. *Excluding interest earned, any government grants received and top-ups made under the Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme. See examples of how the withdrawable amount is computed . Additional amount you can withdraw from 65 The additional withdrawable savings from 65 is computed based on 20% of your RA savings excluding any cash top-ups, CPF transfers and government grants, less the unconditional $5,000 you can withdraw from 55. This ensures that you do not deplete your retirement savings further, so that you will have a stream of monthly payouts for your living expenses in old age. Example of a member born in 1958: Retirement Account balance at 65 1 : $107,400 (A) Cash top-ups/CPF transfers made under the Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme2: $20,000 (B) Government grants 2 (e.g., Deferment Bonus, matching grants under the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme): $600 (C) Unconditional $5,000 withdrawable from 55: $5,000 (D) Additional withdrawal amount from 65: [(A – B – C) x 20%] – D: $12,360 Notes: 1 If you are an existing CPF LIFE member who had joined the scheme before you turned 65, the balances used to compute your additional withdrawable savings from 65 will include your CPF LIFE premium balance. 2 Cash top-ups, CPF transfers and government grants are meant to be streamed out to you as monthly payouts in retirement.

Can I withdraw my Retirement Account savings using my property? FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter I have used CPF savings for my property which the remaining lease can last me until age 95. Can I withdraw my Retirement Account savings using my property? If your expected housing refund is enough to restore your Full Retirement Sum (FRS) You can set aside your FRS with a mixture of property (up to half the FRS) and cash, and withdraw your Retirement Account (RA) savings down to your Basic Retirement Sum (BRS*) without pledging your property. If your expected housing refund is not enough to restore your Full Retirement Sum You can still choose to set aside your FRS with a mixture of property (up to half the FRS) and cash, and withdraw part of your RA savings down to your BRS* if you pledge your property. It is important to note that the amount of RA savings you can withdraw excludes interest earned, any government grants received and top-ups to your retirement savings . It also depends on your RA balance at the point of withdrawal. For example, if you are on CPF LIFE and have started your monthly payouts, any new inflows received in your RA will be used to increase your CPF LIFE premium to provide you with higher monthly payouts, and you will not be allowed to withdraw them in a lump sum. You can refer to the examples on whether your expected housing refund is enough to restore your Full Retirement Sum. * Excluding interest, any government grants and top-ups made under the Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme.

Can I withdraw my Retirement Account savings using my property? FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter I did not use my CPF savings for my property. Can I withdraw my Retirement Account savings using my property? If the property is able to last you until age 95, you can choose to set aside your Full Retirement Sum (FRS) with a mixture of property (up to half the FRS) and cash, and withdraw your Retirement Account (RA) savings down to your Basic Retirement Sum* by pledging your property. By doing so, you will have to refund the amount withdrawn when you sell or transfer the property in future. A charge will be created on the property to secure the refund. The amount you can withdraw depends on a few factors: your property’s market value; outstanding mortgage loan(s); your co-owner(s)’ CPF usage for the property; and the manner of holding of your property (e.g. sole ownership, joint tenancy, tenancy-in-common in equal shares, tenancy-in-common in unequal shares). If you are not the sole owner of the property, you will need to get the consent of all co-owners to create a charge on the property, as the refund of your withdrawn savings will affect their share of the sales proceeds. You can refer to the examples provided to see how your withdrawal amount is calculated. * Excluding interest, any government grants and top-ups made under the Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme.

What happens if I sell or transfer the property? If you have withdrawn part of your Retirement Account (RA) savings using your property, you will need to refund the following when you sell or transfer the property: the CPF principal amount that you had withdrawn for your property including the accrued interest (P+I); and the amount withdrawn from RA that you have pledged to refund, if any. The refunds will be made from your sales proceeds and will be used to restore your RA up to your Full Retirement Sum (FRS) , which will increase* your monthly payouts. This is important when you no longer own a property and will likely need to set aside more savings for higher monthly payouts to cover your rental and living expenses. *If you are on CPF LIFE and have started your monthly payouts, the refunds to your RA will be used to increase your CPF LIFE premium .

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Can I withdraw my Retirement Account savings if my property lease cannot last me until I am 95? No, you will not be able to set aside your Full Retirement Sum (FRS) with a mixture of property (up to half the FRS) and cash with a property that cannot last you until 95. Therefore, you will not be able to withdraw part of your Retirement Account (RA) savings. With Singaporeans living longer, it is important for you to have a property to live in during retirement. If you do not have a property that will last you to at least age 95, you may need to tap on your monthly payouts for your future housing needs such as rental cost, in the event that you outlive the lease. However, exceptions can be made if you have bought property and turned 55 before 10 May 2019, provided your property: has more than 30 years of remaining lease at the date of your withdrawal application; and is not under the short-lease 2-room Flexi or Lease Buyback Scheme. If you meet the above conditions, you may be eligible to set aside your FRS with a mixture of property (up to half your FRS) and cash, and withdraw part of your RA savings down to your Basic Retirement Sum* using your property. * Excluding interest, any government grants and top-ups made under the Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme.

Can I still choose to withdraw my Retirement Account savings using my property? FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter I am an undischarged bankrupt. Can I still choose to withdraw my Retirement Account savings using my property? Whether you can withdraw your Retirement Account (RA) savings using your property depends on whether you own an HDB or private property. For HDB property owners You can choose to set aside your Full Retirement Sum (FRS) with a mixture of property (up to half your FRS) and cash, and withdraw part of your RA savings down to your Basic Retirement Sum (BRS*) if your HDB property can last you until 95. For private property owners You can choose to set aside your FRS with a mixture of property (up to half your FRS) and cash, and withdraw part of your RA savings down to your BRS* if your private property can last you until 95 and the expected housing refund is enough to restore your Full Retirement Sum (FRS). However, if you have not used your CPF savings for your property, or the expected housing refund is not enough to restore your FRS, you will not be able to withdraw your RA savings. This is because no additional charge can be created on your property. If you need more information, you can approach the Official Assignee. It is important to note that the amount of RA savings you can withdraw excludes interest earned, any government grants received and top-ups to your retirement savings . It also depends on your RA balance at the point of withdrawal. For example, if you are on CPF LIFE and have started your monthly payouts, any new inflows received in your RA will be used to increase your CPF LIFE premium to provide you with higher monthly payouts, and you will not be allowed to withdraw them in a lump sum. * Excluding interest, any government grants and top-ups made under the Retirement Sum Topping-Up Scheme.

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter What should I do if I need to withdraw more than the maximum online Daily Withdrawal Limit? The Daily Withdrawal Limit only applies to online CPF lump sum withdrawals made under withdrawals for immediate needs for members aged 55 and above . If you need to withdraw an amount above the maximum Daily Withdrawal Limit of $50,000, you may consider doing so online over multiple days. Alternatively, you may also wish to consider booking an appointment (Select ‘Retirement Income’ then ‘Withdrawal above maximum online Daily Withdrawal Limit’) to withdraw your preferred amount in person at CPF Service Centres. Generally, the next available appointment would be in a week’s time; subsequently, members will receive their withdrawn CPF savings in their bank account registered with us generally within five working days. To minimise any potential delay during the withdrawal process, we encourage members intending to make large withdrawals to plan in advance. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Why is CPF Board lowering the maximum online Daily Withdrawal Limit to $50,000 now? The lowering of the maximum online Daily Withdrawal Limit (DWL) to $50,000 is part of an ongoing process to strengthen safeguards against scams. As published in SPF’s Mid-Year Scams and Cybercrime brief, there were over 26,000 reported scams in Singapore in the first half of 2024, of which less than 0.1% involved CPF withdrawals. Majority of these scam victims who withdrew their CPF savings had raised their DWL above the default $2,000 before making the CPF withdrawals. While the proportion of scam cases involving CPF withdrawals was small and the withdrawals were all authorised by the victims, the impact on the victims can be significant, especially if they had increased their DWL to make larger withdrawals. To strengthen safeguards against scams, CPF Board will lower the maximum DWL from $200,000 to $50,000 with effect from 25 September 2024. This will provide more friction against scams, and more time to prevent further losses without inconveniencing the vast majority of members making legitimate withdrawals today.

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Why do I need to update my registered bank account with CPF Board to my PayNow NRIC-linked bank account to make PayNow withdrawals if I have already withdrawn via PayNow previously? With PayNow, you can withdraw CPF savings for immediate retirement needs from age 55 to your bank account almost instantly. As part of CPF Board’s ongoing efforts to better safeguard CPF members against scams, to make a PayNow withdrawal, you will need to do a one-time update of your registered bank account with CPF Board to your PayNow NRIC-linked bank account via Account settings . This update will be subject to a 12-hour cooling period and may require enhanced authentication, similar to existing safeguards when you update your personal account details. Once your PayNow NRIC-linked bank account has been activated with CPF Board, it will be used to receive your CPF withdrawals and monthly payouts. This update is required even if you have withdrawn via PayNow previously, as a one-time exercise to strengthen security against scams. We recognise the inconvenience but seek your understanding that this additional safeguard is necessary to provide a greater level of security to CPF members. Was this article helpful?

To do so, you will need to: Submit an online application after logging in via Singpass. The application form will allow you to concurrently apply for both Home Protection Scheme (HPS) and Dependants Protection Scheme (DPS) benefits if applicable.

The medical institution will need to submit the completed medical certification to CPF Board within 90 days of your application. Otherwise, your application will be cancelled.

The employment information will allow us to accurately determine your claim event date and amount of claim benefits. A FormSG link will be provided to you upon submission of the online application.

After CPF Board receives the completed medical certification and employment information (for HPS claim, if required), you will receive an email or SMS notifying you that the application is in progress. You will be required to register or update your contact details under Account settings before proceeding with the online application so that you will receive the necessary notifications.

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Do I qualify for the Silver Support Scheme? The Silver Support (SS) Scheme is meant to support seniors who had low incomes during their working years and now have less in retirement. To identify this target group, three criteria are used in tandem – lifetime wages, housing type, and the level of household support. Singapore citizens aged 65 and above will be eligible for the SS Scheme if they meet all of the following criteria: 1. Low lifetime wages - Total CPF contributions* by age 55 is not more than $140,000. Self-employed persons should also have an average annual net trade income # of not more than $27,600 when they were between the ages of 45 and 54; and 2. Housing type - Live in a 1- to 5-room HDB flat; and do not own, or have a spouse who owns, a 5-room or larger HDB flat, private property or multiple properties; and 3. Low household support - Live in a household with a monthly income per person of not more than $1,800. Silver Support will be enhanced in 2025. For the updated eligibility criteria from 2025, please refer to our FAQs . CPF Board will automatically review your eligibility for SS every year. Seniors who qualify for the Silver Support (SS) Scheme will receive a notification in December of the preceding year. Eligible seniors turning age 65 will be notified of their eligibility in December of the year before they turn 65. They will start receiving SS in the quarter they turn 65. In addition to the notification, all Singaporeans aged 65 and above can check their SS eligibility by logging in to the SS e-services using their Singpass. *Total CPF contributions refers to the total sum in an individual’s Ordinary Account and Special Account, including the amounts withdrawn for housing, education and investment. # Net trade income refers to the gross trade income minus all allowable business expenses, capital allowances and trade losses as determined by IRAS.

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Why are my total CPF contributions used as a reflection of my lifetime wages in the assessment of eligibility of the Silver Support Scheme? CPF contributions are proportionate to a person’s wage. They thus serve as an indicator of one’s ability to save. We will look at the senior’s total CPF contributions by the age of 55 to assess his/her eligibility for the Silver Support Scheme. This refers to the sum of contributions to the Ordinary Account (OA) and Special Account (SA), as well as any CPF savings that had been withdrawn for housing, investment and education.

For the assessment of eligibility for the Silver Support Scheme, we do not look at CPF contributions after the age of 55, so as to encourage older Singaporeans to continue working and saving for retirement. We have also set the cut-off age at 55 to provide a meaningful comparison across cohorts, which experience different sets of CPF withdrawal rules and wage adjustments after age 55.

An eligibility criterion of $140,000 set for the Silver Support Scheme would include seniors who were earning lower wages through their working lives, and those who did not work due to reasons such as care-giving responsibilities and medical conditions. The Total CPF Contributions threshold was increased from $70,000 to $140,000 in 2021 to strengthen support for seniors with lesser means.

How will the Government assess my eligibility for the Silver Support Scheme? FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter I am a self-employed person. How will the Government assess my eligibility for the Silver Support Scheme? As it is not mandatory for self-employed persons to contribute to their Ordinary and Special Accounts, self-employed persons would naturally have made less CPF contributions than employees. For seniors who were self-employed in their working years, we will consider their average annual net trade income, as determined by their annual income tax assessments, in addition to the total CPF contributions they made by the age of 55. To qualify for the Silver Support Scheme, their average annual net trade income should be not more than $27,600 between the ages of 45 and 54. The average annual net trade income threshold was increased from $22,800 to $27,600 in 2021 to strengthen support for seniors with lesser means.

The Silver Support (SS) Scheme is meant for seniors who had low incomes during their working years and now have less in retirement. To automatically identify seniors who are eligible for SS, the Government has to rely on available data as broad indicators of an individual’s ability to save for retirement, access to resources and family support. We have relied on the household monthly income per person as a broad indicator of the level of family support available. Was this article helpful?

FAQs FAQs Facebook Facebook Telegram WhatsApp Email LinkedIn Twitter Why is a senior not eligible for the Silver Support Scheme if he and/or his spouse together own a 5-room or larger HDB flat, private property or multiple properties? The type of home owned is an indicator of the senior’s resources. Those who own a 5-room or larger HDB flat, private property or multiple properties are more likely to have more resources and access to additional retirement income. They would be less likely to require assistance through the Silver Support (SS) Scheme. There are other schemes to help seniors cope with daily expenses, finance their healthcare needs and increase their retirement savings. Even if you do not qualify for the SS, you can still benefit from many of these schemes. Those who need additional support can turn to other forms of assistance such as ComCare and MediFund. They may wish to approach a nearby Social Service Office for assistance. Was this article helpful?

You are encouraged to register for PayNow-NRIC with a PayNow-GIRO-participating local or foreign bank in Singapore to receive your Silver Support (SS) earlier. Payment will be made by default to your PayNow-NRIC-linked bank account. If you do not have a PayNow-NRIC-linked bank account, you can update your bank account details by logging in to our SSS e-services with your Singpass. The instruction will only take effect from the next quarter of SS, if you continue to be eligible. The Government will be validating the bank account details that you have registered. If you have closed your bank account, ceased being a joint account holder, or have provided the wrong bank account details, we will inform you to update your bank account details. You will receive a notification sent to your Singpass app. If you do not have the app, a letter will be sent to your NRIC address. This notification will not be sent via SMS, WhatsApp or any other platforms. If you have not linked your NRIC to PayNow or have not provided a valid bank account to the Government, you will receive future Government cash benefits via GovCash. GovCash is a payment mode where you can withdraw your Government benefits in cash from OCBC ATMs. Citizens who are on GovCash will receive their cash benefits 2-3 weeks later than those who have linked their NRIC to PayNow or have provided a valid bank account.

GovCash is a payment mode that allows Singapore citizens to withdraw their Government benefits in cash from over 500 OCBC ATMs located across Singapore. Singaporeans who prefer to seek assistance with their GovCash withdrawals can visit the ATMs located within OCBC's branches during operating hours, where OCBC Digital Ambassadors will be present to guide them. In addition, GovCash also allows recipients to use the scan-and-pay function and PayNow transfer option through the LifeSG mobile app. GovCash is as secure as receiving payments via cheque. It adopts the Singpass Face Verification technology to authenticate users, including a liveness-detection capability that blocks the use of photographs, videos, or masks during the verification process. Users are also required to key in their unique 8-digit Payment Reference Number (PRN) during the withdrawal of the Government benefits at the OCBC ATMs. Was this article helpful?
